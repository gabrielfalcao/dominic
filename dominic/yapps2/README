Yapps 2 is by Amil Patel <amitp@cs.stanford.edu>.

The official Yapps 2 distribution is available from:
http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/yapps/

A version of Yapps 2 is included in this distribution, to avoid
introducing an external dependency.  This version of Yapps 2 has been
modified to add a "no-support-module" parser option, which suppresses
inclusion of the "from yappsrt include *" line in the generated parser.
