# Why ?

As a webdeveloper I have to handle HTML nodes within python code all
the time.

Hence this I love [lxml](http://codespeak.net/lxml/) and have a
extensively use of it's
[CSSSelector](http://codespeak.net/lxml/cssselect.html), I mean,
totally.

Althrough, lxml is built with
[C-based](http://www.python.org/doc/ext/intro.html) python extensions,
and whenever I need to use it in a sandboxed environment,
[Google App Engine](http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=18),
for example, I cannot use lxml.

So that, when I've met
[py-dom-xpath](http://code.google.com/p/py-dom-xpath/), I decided to
write my own python implementation of CSSSelector, which translates
into xpath paths.

# Inspiration and thanks

dominic's test suite is a python port of sizzle's test suite.

thanks to [@jeresig](http://github.com/jeresig) for its **TERRIFIC** work
on [sizzle](http://github.com/jeresig/sizzle), such a clean and
easy-to-understand test suite.

thanks to [py-dom-xpath](http://code.google.com/p/py-dom-xpath/) crew,
it rocks out loud!
